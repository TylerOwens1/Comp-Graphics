How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Working in OpenGL has forced me to slow down how I program. I typically like to work on larger pieces of code before I test it, but in OpenGL it can be harder to find a mistake if you are doing a lot of work and not testing thoroughly along the way. This forced me to take a more methodical, step by step approach so that I could always back up one step to figure out the solution to a problem I was encountering. I like to approach software by creating the most core and reusable parts of a project first. I think taking the more methodical step by step approach will be especially useful when I am coding in unfamiliar libraries. By programming in smaller pieces I will be able to quickly fix any mistakes while still keeping the pace relatively high.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

While working on my 3D scene I developed a more test driven development style, that is I would try to change a single aspect of code and then test that change right away. This led into iterative development where I would tackle a single aspect of a single goal of the project and test it before moving onto the next one. I definitely have gotten better at testing as often as I could so that I could solve problems immediately. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

For me, computational graphics have shown me a new level of coding. So far I have been mainly coding at the application level but with computer graphics I had to think about the processing level while creating shaders.  This will help me in future classes wherever working on a project that interacts with the processing level. This also gives me a good starting place to think about a professional future in computer graphics.
